**Note:** We have recently released a new batch of touch panels that have a higher sensitivity. Drivers on boards manufactured after May 2016 will include the drivers pre-installed on the system.  
If you have purchased an older version LattePanda but want to use the newer capacitive touch panel, you can download the V1.1 drivers below and manually install them.  

  
**PLEASE NOTE:** “install.bat” must be run as an administrator to update the driver correctly.
